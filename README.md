# BlogFeeds

BlogFeeds is a React application that fetches and displays a feed of blog posts using an infinite scroll feature. It utilizes Axios for fetching data, React for UI rendering, and other dependencies for additional functionalities.

## Installation

To install the dependencies and run the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RinshidKP/blogfeeds-client.git
cd blogfeeds
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Usage

Once the development server is running, you can access the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`. The application will display a feed of blog posts fetched from the specified API endpoint. You can scroll infinitely to load more posts.
